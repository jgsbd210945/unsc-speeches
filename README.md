# UNSC Speech Processing

The following is my processing of UNSC Speech and meeting data for an upcoming project on democratic backsliding's effect on international cooperation.
In this project, I aim to understand three things:
- How do backsliding and/or entrenched non-democratic states resist cooperation in IOs?
- Do backsliding states resist cooperation in international institutions more than their entrenched counterparts?
- Do backsliding and entrenched states vote/speak in a coordinated fashion?

Here, I am using general voting and rhetoric data with counting and clustering methods in order to fuel my results.
